I am a dedicated and committed professional with a passion for optimizing performance and continuously learning. 
As a 25-year-old, I have already discovered the enjoyment of working with data, from cleaning and
transformation to visualization. I have also developed a keen interest in machine learning models and am determined to pursue a career in this field for life.
During my academic journey, I gained valuable experience in data management and analysis, and I have since built on this knowledge through self-directed learning and personal projects.
I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology and am always striving to learn new skills and techniques.
As a team player, I am driven to leave a positive impact on my teams and projects. 
I thrive on introducing new features and innovations, and I always strive to create a positive and productive working environment.

This is my new hobby - software engineering. And I decided to create this github profile to document all of my journey since 0 to get a job in this area.
